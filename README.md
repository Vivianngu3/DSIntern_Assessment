## How Can I... determine the extent of importance of changing variables among the league levels?

## General Questions

1. What is Starcraft?
 Resources around the map
 Summon supply gatherers for resources
 Increase money and resources to build bases & units

2. Transformations?

3. Feature selection: EDA Correlation plot for column selection, heatmap view. Maybe just 2 column plots- like a scatter plot between 2 columns. Selcted features 

4. What model to build?

5. Model performance

6. Next steps and what I learned...Data collection methods: privacy/ethics,
